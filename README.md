# Líf

Líf is the token of the Winding Tree platform.

Líf is based on the ERC20 token protocol, with the option to also send information between token holders using edited versions of the transfer and transferFrom methods.
Lif is also a DAO, the token holders can create proposals to change token variables and send value/data to another contracts.

## Install

```sh
npm install
```

## Contract lifecycle

By lifecycle we mean how the status changes, under what conditions, who can do it and what you can do each status.

1.- First the contract is deployed on status 0, where teh deployer specify the base proposal fee, max supply, proposal blocks wait, exponential increment of votes rewards and minimun votes needed to create a proposal.
  ```
  // LifToken constructor
  function LifToken(uint _baseProposalFee, uint _maxSupply, uint _proposalBlocksWait, uint _votesIncrementSent, uint _votesIncrementReceived, uint _minProposalVotes) {
      ...
  }
  ```
2.- This funciton can be called only by the owner of the contract. Here the owner need to specify the starting price and the tokens can start to be sold.
  ```
  function startCrowdSale(uint _tokenPrice) { ... }
  ```
3.- Once the crowdsale ends the owner of the contract can start the DAO, here the organization will take control of the contract.
  ```
  function startDAO() { ... }
  ```

## Token Methods

### transfer

Transfer tokens from one address to another.
```
transfer(address _to, uint _value, string _data) => (bool success)
```
Returns: bool, Success of the operation.

### transferFrom

Transfer  an allowed amount of tokens from one address to another.
```
transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint _value, string _data) => (bool success)
```
Returns: bool, Success of the operation.

### balanceOf

Get the balance of the address.
```
balanceOf(address _owner) => (uint balance)
```
Returns: uint, balance of the address.

### approve

Allow an address to spent a certain amount of tokens.
```
approve(address _spender, uint _value) => (bool success)
```
Returns: bool, Success of the operation.

### allowance

Get the amounts of tokens allowed to be transfered between addresses.
```
allowance(address _owner, address _spender) => (uint remaining)
```
Returns: uint, balance of tokens allowed to be transfered.

## DAO Methods

In order for the DAO to work the deployer of the contract has to set the minimun votes required for every action that the DAO can execute, so once the contract is created the deployer has to use buildMinVotes() function to define the votes needed for every action type, after that the start() method can be called by the deployer and start the DAO.

Every DAO proposal will be an action type, depend on the action type the amounts of votes that will be required by the contract to execute the proposal. Every function on Ethereum has a signature, data,  value.
The signature is what the contract need to know what function execute, the data is the data that will be sent to this function and the value are the ethers that would be transferred on the function call, each function call is a transaction on the blockhain.

### Standard DAO functions

This functions can be called only internally, in order to do that a token holder needs to create a proposal and reach the necessary votes to be executed.

```
setBaseProposalFee(uint _baseProposalFee)
setProposalBlocksWait(uint _proposalBlocksWait)
sendEther(address _to, uint _amount)
setStatus(uint _newStatus)
changeDaoAction(address _target, uint _balanceNeeded, bytes4 _signature)
removeDAOAction(address _target, bytes4 _signature)
addDAOAction(address _target, uint _balanceNeeded, bytes4 _signature)
```

### New Proposal

Creates a new proposal on the token, the token holder that creates the proposal needs to have the more than the fee charged for the proposal creation.
```
newProposal( address _target, uint _value, string _description, uint _agePerBlock, bytes4 _signature, bytes _actionData )
```
### Vote

Vote a proposal for yes or no using the proposal ID.
```
vote( uint _proposalID, bool _vote )
```
